# NYU-UBS-AM-capstone-project
### Introduction
This project aims to develop an App to help users find relevant companies to invest in a specific investment criterion. Other than other existing searches which return millions of results with too much noise, our App provides users with a more personalized experience by offering several filter options and models and returning a small number of high potential companies for users to do investment research on.
The whole project is split into four different tracks: NLP search algorithms, Predictive modeling, Industry tags, Keywords search, and Cloud. Our team focused on NLP search algorithms and also collaborated with students in cloud track to build the App. Neural search, document embeddings, and similar company search are the three main goals of our team.
